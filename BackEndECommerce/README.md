üíª Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and adding the necessary values for `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and other relevant database configuration options.
4. Create the database schema and seed data by running the following commands:
   ```
   mysql -u <username> -p
   source db/schema.sql
   ```
5. Start the server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

üöÄ Usage:
Once the server is running, you can use tools like [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the API routes for categories, products, and tags.

API Routes:
- `GET /api/categories`: Get all categories.
- `GET /api/categories/:id`: Get a single category by its ID.
- `POST /api/categories`: Create a new category.
- `PUT /api/categories/:id`: Update a category by its ID.
- `DELETE /api/categories/:id`: Delete a category by its ID.

- `GET /api/products`: Get all products.
- `GET /api/products/:id`: Get a single product by its ID.
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product.
- `PUT /api/products/:id`: Update a product by its ID.
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`: Delete a product by its ID.

- `GET /api/tags`: Get all tags.
